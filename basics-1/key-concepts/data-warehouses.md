# Data warehouses

![Diagram representing a data Warehouse.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/introduction-to-data-engineering-azure/media/4-data-warehouse.png)

A data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data in relational tables that are organized into a schema that optimizes performance for analytical queries.

Data engineers are responsible for designing and implementing relational data warehouses, and managing regular data loads into tables.
