# Common languages

Data Engineers must be proficient with a range of tools and scripting languages - in particular SQL and Python, and potentially others.

* **SQL** - One of the most common languages data engineers use is SQL, or Structured Query Language, which is a relatively easy language to learn. SQL uses queries that include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to directly work with the data stored in tables.
* **Python** - Python is one of the most popular and fastest growing programming languages in the world. It's used for all sorts of tasks, including web programming and data analysis. It has emerged as the language to learn for machine learning, and is increasing in popularity in data engineering with the use of notebooks.
* **Others** - Depending upon the needs of the organization and your individual skill set, you may also use other popular languages within or outside of notebooks including R, Java, Scala, .NET, and more. The use of notebooks is growing in popularity, and allows collaboration using different languages within the same notebook.
