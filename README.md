### A data engineer integrates, transforms, and consolidates data from various structured and unstructured data systems into structures that are suitable for building analytics solutions. The data engineer also helps design and support data pipelines and data stores that are high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a specific set of business requirements and constraints.
