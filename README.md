# OVERVIEW

> ### Who is a data engineer?
>
> > A data engineer integrates, transforms, and consolidates data from various structured and unstructured data systems into structures that are suitable for building analytics solutions. The data engineer also helps design and support data pipelines and data stores that are high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a specific set of business requirements and constraints.

> ### What is data engineering ?
>
> > The data engineer will often work with multiple types of data to perform many operations using many scripting or coding languages that are appropriate to their individual organization.

> ### What are the functions of a data engineer ?
>
> > * _As a data engineer some of the main tasks that you'll perform in Azure include data integration, data transformation, and data consolidation._
> > * _One of the core responsibilities of a data engineer is to design, implement, and manage solutions that integrate operational and analytical data sources or extract operational data from multiple systems, transform it into appropriate structures for analytics, and load it into an analytical data store (usually referred to as ETL solutions)._
> > * _Data engineers often need to implement solutions that capture real-time stream of data and ingest them into analytical data systems, often combining the real-time data with other application data that is processed in batches._
> > * _Data Pipelines are the primary way in which data engineers implement repeatable extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on a schedule or in response to events._
