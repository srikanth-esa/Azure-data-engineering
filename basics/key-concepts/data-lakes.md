# Data lakes

![Diagram representing a data lake.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/introduction-to-data-engineering-azure/media/4-data-lake.png)

A data lake is a storage repository that holds large amounts of data in native, raw formats. Data lake stores are optimized for scaling to massive volumes (terabytes or petabytes) of data. The data typically comes from multiple heterogeneous sources, and may be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.
