# Streaming data

![Diagram representing streaming data.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/introduction-to-data-engineering-azure/media/4-stream-data.png)

Streaming data refers to perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time, often relating to specific events. Common sources of streaming data include internet-of-things (IoT) devices and social media feeds.

Data engineers often need to implement solutions that capture real-time stream of data and ingest them into analytical data systems, often combining the real-time data with other application data that is processed in batches.
