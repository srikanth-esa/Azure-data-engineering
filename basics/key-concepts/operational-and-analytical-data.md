# Operational and Analytical data

![Diagram representing operational and analytical data.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/introduction-to-data-engineering-azure/media/4-operational-analytical-data.png)

_Operational_ data is usually transactional data that is generated and stored by applications, often in a relational or non-relational database. _Analytical_ data is data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting, often in a data warehouse.

One of the core responsibilities of a data engineer is to design, implement, and manage solutions that integrate operational and analytical data sources or extract operational data from multiple systems, transform it into appropriate structures for analytics, and load it into an analytical data store (usually referred to as ETL solutions).
